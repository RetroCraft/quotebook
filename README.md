# The Quotebook
This is a copy of the code that is running for the quotebook website I made, I'll probably put comments for you later so it's actualy legible code.

## Building a local version
1. Install git and node.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run `npm i` to get all dependancies and thingamajigs.
4. Install gulp with `npm i -g gulp-cli`.
5. Put your database and sftp credentials into `src/php/database.php.example` and `gulpfile.js.example`, then remove the `.example` from the end of the filenames
6. Run `gulp`.
7. ???
8. Profit.
